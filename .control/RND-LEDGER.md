## Cycle 1 — RESEARCH (2026-06-13)

### Proposed improvement: Fix §1091 wash-sale replacement-lot over-attribution

**What:** The `detect_wash_sales` engine (`engines/wash_sale.py`) does not track how many
shares of a replacement lot have been *consumed* across multiple loss sells processed in
the same call. When two loss sells for the same ticker both fall within the 61-day window
of a single replacement buy, the engine assigns that replacement buy to *both* sells without
subtracting the shares already used, causing the disallowed-loss amount and the replacement
lot's adjusted basis to be over-reported.

**Confirmed bug (reproduced in RESEARCH step):**

```
src1  QQQ buy  Jan 1  20 sh @ $100   (source lot)
s1    QQQ sell Jan 10 10 sh proceeds=$90  → cost=$100/sh, loss=$100
s2    QQQ sell Jan 11 10 sh proceeds=$89  → cost=$100/sh, loss=$110
rep   QQQ buy  Jan 20 10 sh @ $95   (replacement — 10 shares ONLY)
```

Current engine output:
- s1 → rep, disallowed $100  ✗
- s2 → rep, disallowed $110  ✗  (rep only has 10 shares; fully consumed by s1)
- rep.adjusted_basis_cents = 116,000  (should be 105,000)

§1091-correct output:
- s1 → rep, disallowed $100  (rep 10 sh fully consumed)
- s2 → no replacement available → loss is ALLOWED (no disallowance)
- rep.adjusted_basis_cents = 105,000

**Why measurable / metric:**
- The fix is verifiable with a deterministic unit test that fails before the fix and
  passes after it (fail-before / pass-after gate).
- Metric: `rep.adjusted_basis_cents` must equal 105,000 (not 116,000) and only 1
  WashSaleResult must be produced (not 2) for the minimal reproduction above.
- Tax correctness impact: over-reported disallowances inflate the replacement lot's
  cost basis, causing the user's future gain on that lot to be under-reported — a
  downstream tax error that flows into Schedule D / Form 8949.

**Why this is the highest-value improvement this cycle:**
- It is a correctness bug in the core §1091 tax calculation, not a UX or perf issue.
- The current test suite has no test for the multi-sell / shared-replacement-lot scenario;
  the gap is real (confirmed by reading all tests in `tests/test_wash_sale.py`).
- The fix is narrow, reversible, and self-contained: add a `_consumed_qty` dict keyed
  by `rep_buy.id`, subtract `covered_qty` from its available shares, and skip when
  available shares reach zero.
- The event→DB persistence work (PRs #43/#44) was just completed; the MAINTAIN task
  of proving a real trade.filled persists a row is already covered by
  `TestHandleTradeFilledBuy.test_buy_creates_lot_row` and the full E2E fakeredis test
  in `TestEventBusEndToEnd`. No new value from repeating that here.

**Verify plan:**

Fail-before:
```python
# test_wash_sale_replacement_capacity.py
def test_replacement_lot_not_reused_beyond_its_share_count():
    lots = [
        LotRecord('src1', 'QQQ', 'buy',  date(2024, 1,  1), 20, 200_000),
        LotRecord('s1',   'QQQ', 'sell', date(2024, 1, 10), 10,  90_000),
        LotRecord('s2',   'QQQ', 'sell', date(2024, 1, 11), 10,  89_000),
        LotRecord('rep',  'QQQ', 'buy',  date(2024, 1, 20), 10,  95_000),
    ]
    lots[1].adjusted_basis_cents = 100_000
    lots[2].adjusted_basis_cents = 100_000
    adjusted, results = detect_wash_sales(lots)
    # rep has only 10 shares; s1 consumes them fully
    # s2 has no replacement → loss is allowed
    assert len(results) == 1          # FAILS currently (returns 2)
    assert results[0].sell_lot_id == 's1'
    rep = next(l for l in adjusted if l.id == 'rep')
    assert rep.adjusted_basis_cents == 105_000  # FAILS currently (returns 116000)
```

Pass-after: same test passes once `_consumed_qty` tracking is added to the inner loop.

**Pipeline proof:** `951 passed` on `fix/alembic-event-persistence-tables` (baseline confirmed
in RESEARCH step). After fix, count must be >= 952 (existing 951 + new test(s)).

**Gated?** No — purely advisory/simulation tax logic. No IRS filing, no e-file, no credentials.

**Status:** RESEARCH complete. DEVELOP not yet started.

### Honesty note

- Test count at research time: **951 passing** (not ~948 as in charter brief; confirmed by
  running `pytest --no-cov` in the RESEARCH step).
- The MAINTAIN item "prove a trade.filled persists a row" is already covered by existing tests
  (`TestHandleTradeFilledBuy.test_buy_creates_lot_row`, `TestEventBusEndToEnd`). No additional
  work needed there.
- The replacement-lot capacity bug was found by code-reading + a live reproduction probe, not
  from an existing failing test. It is a real gap, not manufactured.
- No holding-period tack-on (§1091 also requires the replacement lot to tack on the holding
  period of the sold shares) was implemented or tested — that is a separate, lower-urgency
  correctness item and is NOT proposed for this cycle (honest scope boundary).
